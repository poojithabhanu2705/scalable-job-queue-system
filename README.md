# Scalable Job Queue System

A scalable backend job processing system built using Node.js, Express, BullMQ, Redis, and MongoDB.

This project demonstrates how modern backend systems handle asynchronous tasks such as emails, notifications, and payments using queues, workers, retries, priorities, and distributed processing.

# Features

* Asynchronous job processing using BullMQ
* Redis-backed queue system
* MongoDB job persistence and tracking
* Multiple job types
* Delayed jobs
* Automatic retries with backoff
* Priority-based job execution
* Multiple worker support
* Job lifecycle tracking
* Queue event listeners
* REST APIs for querying jobs
* Scalable architecture

# How It Works

1. Client sends a request to create a job.
2. Express API adds the job to BullMQ.
3. BullMQ stores the job in Redis.
4. Workers consume jobs asynchronously.
5. MongoDB tracks job state and metadata.
6. Failed jobs retry automatically.
7. APIs expose job information externally.

# Job Lifecycle

```text
waiting → active → completed
```

or

```text
waiting → active → failed
```

---

# Supported Features

## Delayed Jobs

Jobs can be scheduled to execute after a delay.

## Retries and Backoff

Failed jobs retry automatically with configurable delay.

## Priority Jobs

Higher priority jobs are processed before lower priority jobs.

## Multiple Workers

The system supports horizontal scaling by running multiple workers.

## Persistent Tracking

MongoDB stores job information permanently for querying and monitoring.

---

# API Endpoints

## Add Job

```http
POST /jobs/add-job
```

Example Request:

```json
{
  "type": "email",
  "data": {
    "email": "test@gmail.com"
  },
  "priority": 1
}
```

---

## Get All Jobs

```http
GET /jobs/all
```

---

## Get Job By ID

```http
GET /jobs/:id
```

---

## Get Jobs By Status

```http
GET /jobs/status/:status
```

Example:

```http
GET /jobs/status/completed
```

---

# Installation

## 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/poojithabhanu2705/scalable-job-queue-system.git
